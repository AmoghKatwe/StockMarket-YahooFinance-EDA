# StockMarket-YahooFinance-EDA
In this project I will focus on the exploratory data analysis of stock prices that we retrieve from yahoo finance using pandas

### We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis of 2016

### We can get stock information for the following banks:
*  Bank of America
* CitiGroup
* Goldman Sachs
* JPMorgan Chase
* Morgan Stanley
* Wells Fargo

### We pull the stock data from Jan 1st 2006 to Jan 1st 2016 for each of these banks. Set each bank to be a separate dataframe, with the variable name for that bank being its ticker symbol.
